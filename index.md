### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was easily one of my favorite labs this semester because it required us to make if
    statements using nothing but trial and error. The reason I found it interesting is because I got
    to see first hand how differently someone would tackle this problem (in this case my partners).
* Lab 6
    
    Lab 6, part 1 was also a lab that I enjoyed this semester. The reason being is that it was our 
    Introduction to vectors. In the lab we were tasked with filtering the vector's to count a specific argument multiples of twos and three with fives.
* Lab 5
    
    Lab 5, part 1 was one of the projects that may have not been though but the fundamentals I learned would help in later labs. The code asked us to create a Madlib game that filled in the blanks of a sentence that we were given. What I found interesting is that the code needed to be run through a shell command which is basic but was a strange concept to me since I had never used a shell command.
